Notes on a rewrite: Making DocumentViewer work with NYPL's Djatoka server & URL structure:

Part 1:
	JSON:
		JSON format will need modification as will parser
		Needs to:
			take an array of UUID's corresponding to repository IDs
			Take a base URL to djatoka server
		maybe should: eliminate number of pages and instead calculate from the array of UUID's.

		Parser needs to:
			take array and assign to individual page objects
		I believe each page is represented as an object and the URL to that page is stored in there, rather than calculated on the fly (this may be completely wrong)
